<h2>Introduction of some fun instruments</h2>

I will introduce four fun instruments. They are piano, violin, tabla, and clarinet. Click <a href=http://www.musikschule-regionschallaburg.at/unterrichtsangebot/unterrichtsfaecher/violoncello/@@images/image/large>here</a> to see the picture of my favorite instrument! 

<br>

Piano belongs to keyboard family, which means we can play it with our hands like typing on keyboard.

<br>

Violin is a string instrument. From its appearance, we can clearly see strings on it. Then, we just need to use the bow and rosin to make sound.

<br>

I do not know much about tabla, but I assume we can just hit its surface. It is pretty easy! Everyone can be a drum master!

<br>

To make sound on clarinet, we should first put the reed and blow, which will allow the reed to vibrate. The vibration of the reed and then the air create the sound.

<h2>data.html information</h2>
<p>
For Lab02, I would like to analyze the data about the traffic in Atlanta. I hope to get the data of how many cars are on the interstate every 15 minutes, and I will analyze how they changes from morning to night. The reason I want to do it is becasue the traffic information shows on google map is always incorrect. I hope to have a better understanding of traffic situation in Atlanta through this data analysis. 

This link goes to the data analysis homework file. It is empty now and will be fill out on Lab02. <a href="data.html">data.html</a> 
Here is another one. <a href="data.html">data2.html</a>
